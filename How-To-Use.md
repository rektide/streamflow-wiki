## Overview
When the StreamFlow application is started, an embedded Jetty server is initialized utilizing the `server.port` property in the `streamflow.yml` configuration.  To load the StreamFlow UI, browse to `http://{SERVER_HOST}:{SERVER_PORT}` from any popular web browser.

_Note: If you do not see the `server.port` property in your configuration or you have not modified the configuration, the default port is `8080`_

If the StreamFlow server was started successfully, you should see the StreamFlow UI load.  If authentication is enabled in the configuration, you should see the StreamFlow login dialog overlaid on the StreamFlow UI.  The screenshot below shows the default view of the StreamFlow UI.

## Dashboard
The [Dashboard](Dashboard) tool can be loaded at any time by clicking on the "Dashboard" link in the main toolbar of the StreamFlow web application.  The [Dashboard](Dashboard) is also loaded as the default interface when first logging into StreamFlow.
