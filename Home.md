Welcome to the StreamFlow open source project!

StreamFlow&trade; is a stream processing tool designed to rapidly build and monitor processing workflows.  The ultimate goal of StreamFlow is to make working with stream processing frameworks such as Apache Storm easier, faster, and with "enterprise" like management functionality.  StreamFlow provides a graphical user interface for non-developers such as data scientists, analysts, or operational users to rapidly build scalable data flows and analytics.

StreamFlow provides the following capabilites: 

1. A **responsive web interface** for building and monitoring Storm topologies.
2. An interactive **drag and drop topology builder** for authoring new topologies
3. A **dashboard** for monitoring the status and performance of topologies as well as viewing aggregated topology logs.
4. A speciaized **topology engine** which solves some Storm complexities such as ClassLoader isolation and serialization and provides a mechanism for dependency injection.
5. A **modular framework** for publishing and organizing new capabilities in the form of Spouts and Bolts.
